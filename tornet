TorNet, commonly referred to as the Tor network, is a decentralized network that anonymizes internet traffic to enhance privacy and security.
In Kali Linux, Tor can be installed and configured to route internet traffic through multiple relays, hiding your IP address and encrypting your data,
which is valuable for privacy-focused activities, penetration testing, and ethical hacking. Hereâ€™s how you can get started with Tor in Kali Linux:

#1. Installing Tor
Open a terminal and update your repositories:
**sudo apt update**
Then, install Tor:
**sudo apt install tor**
To start the Tor service, use:
**sudo systemctl start tor**
to check Status 
**sudo systemctl status tor**
#use dnsleaktest.com for testing dns leak (ip)

after this go to firefox setting 
then select network setting 
select manula proxy configuration 
SOCKS Hosts 127.0.0.1   
port 9050
check Proxy DNS when using SOCKS.v5
then **ok**

come to command prommt again 
**sudo tornet --interval 5 --count 0**
**sudo tornet --interval time_in_sec --count 0**
